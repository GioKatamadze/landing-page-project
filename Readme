Hello, This repository involves non-commercial practise of creating landing page from the design.
Design folder contains the layout of the page and font specs, which I used as a guide to build page.
Index HTML, contains the data, which I changed only two times, firstly I packed on the server all items, and on second edit, I rearranged items for better positioning when using FlexBox.
Styles.css is little bit overwhelmed, but the result of the FlexBox and over all final result is amazing, Design and outcome are exactly the same.
